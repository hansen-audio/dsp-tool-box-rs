# DSP Tool Box for Rust

## Summary

The ```dsp-tool-box``` contains very basic DSP algorithms. Algorithms can operate on one sample at a time. Like this an update of a parameter can be done any time while processing.

## Building the project

Execute the following commands on cli.

```
git clone https://www.github.com/hansen-audio/dsp-tool-box-rs.git
cd dsp-tool-box-rs
cargo build
cargo test
```

## Algorithms

Currently the following algorithms are available:

* modulation phase
